I was trying to hook up with this singer-songewriter chic in my english class.

Her birthday was the next day and I had just purchased tickets to the musical Sunset Boulevard.

I was downtown after work and it was Friday, Dec 4th 1998.

I felt elated for some reason... pleased with myself no doubt on such a great
birthday present and my now almost guaranteed prospect of hooking up with her.

I began to walk home.

My route was down through the park, across the bridge and then up the incline (sort of a subway car that goes up a mountain) to my apartment.

As I passed the last building before the park began, a homeless woman approached me.

She told me about living under a bridge and her child needed a coat.

The only cash I had was the $5 tip, so I instantly whipped it out and gave it to her.

This was all in stride- I never stopped walking and from behind I hear her say "God bless you"

Again feeling pretty happy with myself and a little too cocky as usual, I reply: "Oh he already has-"

And that's when I saw it.

### enter universe

It came down from the sky over the bridge, along the highway by the park and then to me.

It was like lightning, completely bright white light-

but much larger- with a diameter the width of a two lane road-

the end of it rounded like a ball or almost like the head of a worm.

It was only an instant before it hit me.

I have a sensation of being lifted 100 feet in the air, carried across the bridge and dropped-

all in a matter of seconds.

### exit universe

The next thing I know, I am across the river in tears on the sidewalk.

Ejected from the power, my body seemed to start crying as some sort of shock reaction.

I stumbled up to the incline car and road up the hill.

In a state of shock I stumble home...

I hadn't heard any "voices" or seen really anything-

but now I had only a single thought in my head:

 **_I am here for a reason, a purpose but what?_**.

Once home, I gather my thoughts and called my mom.

She begins to tell me of an eerie prophetic dream she just had.

After waking, it left her with a single thought.

**_I was put on this earth to give birth to you_**.

Un-fucking-believable right? It happened, I swear.
