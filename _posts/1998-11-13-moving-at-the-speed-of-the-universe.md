I relocated to a new city to start college. I was camping nearby while I looked for a place to live, work etc.

I began acting on every thought as it happened.

The fact that I was traveling light facilitated this (no real trivial day to day bullshit to worry just real actions).

Within a day I had found a great place and a job. I kept at this practice for months.

Opportunities kept presenting themselves and everything seemed to fall into my lap almost effortlessly.

became a mantra as I walked across the city

Across the bridges some nights I had the feeling my legs extended to the bottom of the waters and my head into the infinite.

These became the knows as the _keys to infinitcy_ with the mantra _everything hard is really easy_

The idea is to "move" as close to speed of the universe as possible with our bodies and lives.

As the saying goes...

Meeting fate (or the universe) half-way is really all about keeping up with it.

The key is to act immediately on anything you think of.

Do not procrastinate.

Every idea can be acted on - even it is just making a note or setting a reminder.

Most day-to-day tasks can be completed immediately.

This does **not** mean that you need to go looking for things to do.

Just when you think of it or see it - stop and do it.

You'll see immediate results - more things meeting you half-way - more of what seemed hard becoming easy

The closer you get to instant action (when you stop being conscious that you need to stop and do it and you're just doing it)
you can literally feel yourself/life piggy-backing on the power of the universe giving a sensation of effortlessness.
