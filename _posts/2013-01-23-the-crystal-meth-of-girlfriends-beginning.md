# the meetup

Today I met a young woman one night out as a local "meetup" event.
There was something I liked about her immediately- tall, dark features, out spoken...
Her and her friend were leaving to another bar where her friend's boyfriend was the bartender.
I was invited. The house was on the way, so I stopped and did the remaining cocaine I had on hand.

Today was the first day of "shark week" so the boyfriend-bartender had
some shark/ocean themed drinks he wanted to try out on us. We were the only ones there on a Monday night-
the girl, the friend, bartender-boyfriend and me. In an attempt to impress and funny,
I would finish all the drinks he made after the girls would try a sip and give their comments.
We grabbed tacos at food truck and she proclaimed how much she loves steak -
and fuck all the whiny hippie pussies who have a problem with that. She was fantastic.

She wanted to come home with me so she follows me back to the house.
Driving back we stopped at red light and she began honking and waving and screaming, windows down, music blaring.
I thought she was fucking crazy and I loved it.

We got home, went in and she jumped me- stumbled to the bedroom- hit the bed:
clothes were flying, bodies turning..
I remember seeing a perfect firm ass and then the room began to spin.
Spin bad. All those blue hawaiian drinks were coming up-
I leaped from the bed and (nearly) made it to the toilet when..


Moments later, I was on the bathroom floor, spattered in vomit-
It was everywhere. On the floor, on the toilet, in the toilet.
I started to clumsily try to wipe it up.. and then- shit! I had nearly forgot about girl in my bed.

Bring someone home for the first time and then run out of the room puking while making out...
And now what if she needs to use the bathroom?! I finish my clean up burst out of the bathroom
like nothing happened and- she's not there.

She's left, I think - I would of left too! fucking loser!
I walk around the house calling her name. I peek out the back door and see her on the steps having a cigarette.

I open the door and say something apologethic. She just smiles and says
something sweet as she passes me on the way in - as if nothing happened.

We go to bed, she gives me a kiss and we sleep.
