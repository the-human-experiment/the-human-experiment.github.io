This should be regarded really as rule "number one".

Always first see if it's possible to remove the problem.

In other words:

Can the cause of the problem be removed while keeping the intregity of the system intact?

If so, this becomes the easiest and best solution- and complexity has been reduced;

Another interesting property of this rule:

If a problem seems unsolvable or irrational it's cause can usuallly be removed-

it is, by it's own nature, superfluous.
