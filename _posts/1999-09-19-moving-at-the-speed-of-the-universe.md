It should be noted that obivously we cannot travel the actual speed of the universe (the speed of light, energy however you call it)
since we are bound to this world and these bodies. It also should be noted that of course
mentally (spiritually, etc, again however you call it) this _is_ in fact possible- but that's not what we are (directly) talking about today.

Today we are talking about moving as close to speed of the universe as possible
with our bodies and lives -

If you've ever heard of the saying:

> You have to meet fate half-way.

These lessons tie into that directly.

Really meeting _fate_ (or the universe) half-way is all about keeping up with it.

Even after a few small changes you will notice this phenomanon immediately.

The lessons are _simple_:

1. Act immediately on anything you think of.

Do not procrastinate. Every idea can be acted on - even it is just making a
note or setting a reminder.

If this way of life is new to you, you'll be amazed at how many things can
actually be finished immediately.
