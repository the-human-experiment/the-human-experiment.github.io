Today marks the conclusion of the chapter of this life known as:

## the crystal meth of girlfriends

and reminds us of the first rule of problem-solving:

We were impossible. There was no solution. And I unfortunately do not give up on
problems easily if at all- placing the last 92 days of my life in a _very_ short loop I could not break out of.

On january 1st she announces out of nowhere she needs time to think. She needs to leave.

I am at this time, totally consumed with love and desire for her-

a combination of her suggestions, my own suggestions and no doubt a year of solid heavy drug use (the majority being crystal meth)

I still do not deny my feelings for her and even knowing they are irrational and absurd do not deter me!

I created a beautiful place in my mind with her at the center of it -

with nothing other than she is the most beautiful creature on the planet true.

That thought also has been built up, the entire notion and safety of it a farse.

She leaves with no explanation for days... I immediatley sense a problem and call

her back! No she says, it's over. I'm too hurt. We have nothing in common. Sorry.

For the next 90 days, I fought, pleaded, begged and thought non-stop on how can I fix this?

In a deperate cry for attention, I attempted a drug overdose of everything I had on hand:

2 grams of herione, 2 grams of cocaine, 6 grams of crystal meth,
a vial of liquid LSD, some hydro and a few coronas.

somewhere in the night and a pandora playlist, **the suicide turned to celebration**

I bought her plane tickets for trips she said she wanted to go on and then she'd cancel.

I would have flowers delivered at her work, meet her there after-

**It was absolutely pathetic.**

I have known all along the absurdity and the absolute dillusion of it all.

I have come to the same conclusion a million different ways.

I am closing this chapter. She's officially dead to me. She cannot be contacted, she does not exist.

I will remember her as she was the last time I saw her, two days ago when I waited outside her work:

It was rainy and I was sopping wet (from a drug run in the rain).

I told here I was making her favorite meal and she should come over.

I said we should drink wine because of the rain.

She agreed the dinner and wine sounded good.

She wasn't feeling well and was taking a lot of antibiotics (another unrelated long train wreck story).

She gave her usual answer of "Maybe- but I'm not making any promises!"

She said I looked really cute and demanded *two great hugs*.

I bought the food and wine and never heard from her again.
